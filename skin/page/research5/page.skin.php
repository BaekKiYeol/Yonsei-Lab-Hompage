        <p>In the context of tissue engineering, we focus on integrating therapeutic biomaterials and engineered stem cells to promote tissue healing and regeneration. We use a variety of biomaterials, such as hydrogels and nanoparticles that can be customized to match the properties of the target tissue. We also engineer stem cells to differentiate into specific cell types that can promote tissue regeneration and repair. For example, we can engineer stem cells to transdifferentiate into neurons for brain tissue regeneration or into myocytes for skeletal muscle tissue repair.</p>

      <li class="txt2">
        <p>Our research has shown promising results in a variety of tissues, including the brain, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, bone, liver, stomach, and skin. We have observed tissue regeneration and functional recovery in animal models, and we are working towards translating these therapies to clinical applications. Our ultimate goal is to develop innovative and effective therapies for a range of injuries and diseases. </p>

        <p>We utilize both stem cell and cellular reprogramming technology to develop innovative therapies for a range of diseases and injuries.

    <p>Fundamentally, we actively adopt bio-inspired strategies to develop novel and clinically translational biomaterials such as tissue adhesive hydrogels for biomedical applications. We have particularly developed several tissue-adhesive hydrogels by conjugating marine organism-inspired tissue adhesive moieties to various polymers, which demonstrated robust tissue adhesiveness and high therapeutic efficacy as they could deliver stem cells to specific target sites, provide mechanical support for tissue growth and regeneration, and facilitate the integration of newly formed tissue with the host tissue. We also utilize various biomolecules, such as growth factors and extracellular matrix components, to control the behavior of stem cells by creating surfaces that can guide the maintenance, differentiation, and functionality of various stem cells. Furthermore, our recent works have shown that these hydrogels can be further converted into ready-to-use patch or particle forms for prolonged drug delivery, dermal filler, tissue adhesive, and instant hemostasis.</p>

    <p>We explore the potential of decellularized matrices derived from diverse organs or tissues for tissue engineering applications. Using these matrices, we can create  native tissue-mimetic functional hydrogels that can improve stem cell engineering and guide the regeneration of new tissue. This approach has shown promising regenerative efficacy in a range of tissues, including brain, heart, liver, and muscle. </p>

        <p>Our laboratory is actively contributing to the field of organoid engineering and focuses on developing various protocols for culturing multiple organ-specific 3D organoids. We use various types of stem cells, including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and adult stem cells, to generate organoids of different tissues, including the brain, liver, intestine, lung, heart, stomach, pancreas, kidney, and more. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By using 3D organoids, we can model various diseases, infections, inflammations, and fibrosis, enabling us to study the underlying mechanisms and develop new therapies. We are also exploring the use of organoids for high-throughput drug screening and cell therapeutics, taking advantage of microfluidic devices and biomaterials to better recapitulate the in vivo micro-environments and organ functions.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, our laboratory is also engaged in creating multiplex structures using organ-on-a-chip and assembloids, which are multiple organoids assembled together, to study inter-organ communication and crosstalk, as well as to develop more comprehensive models of human development and diseases. Microfluidic systems and nanotechnologies have been established for mass production and scale-up of organoids and assembloids for regenerative therapy and artificial organ fabrication.</p>
